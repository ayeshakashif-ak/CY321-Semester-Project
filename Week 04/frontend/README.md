## 🔒 Security & Authentication

DocuDino implements robust security practices to protect user data and ensure reliable authentication:

- **JWT Tokens** — JSON Web Tokens are used for stateless and secure user authentication
- **Session Management** — Ensures persistent login sessions with proper token handling
- **Protected Routes** — React Router is used with guards to restrict access to authenticated users only
- **Token Refresh Strategy** — Handles token expiration gracefully (if implemented)
- **Secure Storage** — Sensitive tokens are stored securely in memory or via HttpOnly cookies (based on configuration)

> ✅ This ensures a secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication system.
