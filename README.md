# AI-Driven Identity Verification & Document Validation

## üìå Project Overview
With the increasing reliance on digital services, identity verification has become crucial for ensuring authenticity in online transactions. This project focuses on developing an **AI-driven identity verification system** capable of detecting forged documents, extracting relevant information, and ensuring live user verification through facial recognition.

## üõ† Features
- **Forgery Detection**: AI-powered deep learning models identify document alterations.
- **OCR-Based Data Extraction**: Extracts key details (Name, DOB, ID number) and cross-checks against an existing database.
- **Live Face Recognition**: Ensures the uploaded document belongs to the actual user via real-time face matching.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an additional security layer to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure APIs & Data Encryption**: Protects sensitive information using AES-256 encryption and HTTPS communication.

## üèõ Use Cases
Our system is designed for multiple industries, including:
- **Banking & Finance**: Secure customer onboarding, digital loan processing.
- **Government Services**: Passport verification, voter registration, e-Government services.
- **Legal & Compliance**: Notary verification, contract authentication, regulatory submissions.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for AI models)
- OpenCV (for face recognition)
- Flask/Django (for backend API development)
