# DocuDino Backend

**DocuDino** is a secure document management system designed to provide robust authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and AI-driven identity verification. This is the backend portion of the project, providing a secure API for user authentication, document management, and AI-powered verification.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication** â€” JWT-based authentication for user login, registration, and session handling
- **Role-Based Access Control** â€” Different access levels for users, admins, and other roles
- **Document Upload & Verification** â€” Secure document upload and verification using AI and encrypted storage
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** â€” Added layer of security through TOTP and QR code generation
- **Database Security** â€” Encrypted data storage and secure database practices to protect sensitive information
- **Audit Logs** â€” Integrity verification and audit logging for documents and user activities

## ðŸ”’ Security & Authentication

DocuDino implements several security practices to protect sensitive user data:

- **JWT Tokens** â€” Secure, stateless user authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Password Hashing** â€” Passwords are hashed and stored securely using bcrypt
- **Role-Based Access Control** â€” Different user roles with restricted access to certain endpoints
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** â€” Supports OTP generation via Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) for added security
- **Database Encryption** â€” Sensitive data such as user profiles and documents are encrypted
- **Audit Logging** â€” Logs are generated for important user actions to ensure system integrity

> These security practices ensure that DocuDino is both secure and scalable.
