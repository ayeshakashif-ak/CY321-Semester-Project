## üìå Project Overview

In an increasingly digital world, ensuring the authenticity of identities and documents is paramount. **DocuDino** is an **AI-driven identity verification and document validation system** designed to offer secure, efficient, and reliable identity authentication. The platform uses advanced technologies, including deep learning models for forgery detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction, and real-time facial recognition to verify the person behind the document.

With the growing need for digital security, **DocuDino** guarantees the authenticity of online transactions by enabling secure document uploads, real-time face matching, and integration with multi-factor authentication (MFA). By leveraging AI, we aim to reduce identity fraud and enhance the security of digital services.

## üõ† Key Features

- **Forgery Detection**: 
  - Leveraging AI-based deep learning models to automatically detect tampered or forged documents by analyzing patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies.
  
- **OCR-Based Data Extraction**: 
  - Automatically extracts critical information (e.g., Name, Date of Birth, ID number) from uploaded documents and cross-checks it against existing databases to ensure accuracy.
  
- **Live Face Recognition**: 
  - Real-time facial recognition ensures that the person uploading the document is indeed the one depicted on it, enhancing the verification process and preventing impersonation.
  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
  - Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional forms of identity verification such as OTPs, biometrics, or authentication apps.
  
- **Secure APIs & Data Encryption**: 
  - All sensitive information is securely stored and transmitted, with AES-256 encryption applied to both data at rest and in transit. All communications occur over HTTPS to ensure data integrity and privacy.
